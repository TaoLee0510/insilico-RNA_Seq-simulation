Insilico-RNA_Seq-simulation_based_on_the-2nd_sequencing_technology
This program output a expected RNA_seq results (RSEM based read counts) of a mixture population of two different kinds of cells (or tissues) at different mixture ratio.

Note: K data and r data represent the Negative Binomial distribution parameters which fit from the RSME expected read counts data, which analysed from a pure cell or tissue RNA_Seq data.
